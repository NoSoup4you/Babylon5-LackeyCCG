This pack contains all the various rules that are applicable to playing Babylon 5 CCG on Lackey.  I'll give a brief description of each file here in alphabetical order.  There are two main rule sets, the Printed Rules, and the Engine Rules.  I will highlight the source of each document to make it clear what rules set they belong too.  The Printed rules are obviously the officially printed rules used before the game went out of print.  Meanwhile, the Engine rules are a slightly revised rule set that looks to curb some of the most cheesy strategies prevelant in games that run the printed rules set.
